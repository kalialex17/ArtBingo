As of right now we created a website with a functioning grid, functioning API button and a second working page accessible from the grid.
On the camera page you can take a picture and send it to the AI Object Recognition which will give back the most accurate and close object.
On the last update I added a Home page button so that the user is able to go from the Camera page to the fist initial grid page.

Update 6.02.2025
New fonts and colors all around the website. Adjusted camera and photo dimensions to fit smartphones screens. Added timer, points and checks for the grid cells. Adjusted the home button function and finally added a final page at the end of the game.

Update 02.07.2025 Presentation of the project at the DAC Summer School in at the Donau University of Krems
Third version of the prototype, new integration of custom trained model. Adjusted code for implementation and for design.
Model implemented is Roboflow Instant v2, on custom database of 517 copyright free artworks, and 3528 bounding boxes, with the idea of enlarging the current database and train a new and more accurate model (Roboflow Object Detection 3.0 Extra Large or RF-DETR Base Model).
